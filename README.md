# Page Visits Funnel Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented data analysis using R. I used the libraries readr, and dplyr which helped me to build the project. I analyze the data of CoolTShirts.com to gain a better understanding and insight on visits to their website. In order to do this I built a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process. 

In this case, the funnel describes the following process:
1. A user visits CoolTShirts.com
2. A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
3. A user clicks "checkout"
4. A user purchases a t-shirt
 
### Note:

This data comes from CoolTShirts.com
 
### Results:

The goal of this project is to learn how much time, on average, a user takes to purchase an item on the website.

I first loaded the data files onto RStudio.

Afterwards, I inspected the data frames to see what kind of data I had to analyze.

I decided to remove the number column becuase it impacted the *left_join* function. The resulting would be NA for the *cart_time* column. In order to fix this, I removed the number column with *NULL*. The *left_join* is joining by *user_id*.
