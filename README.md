# Page Visits Funnel Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented data analysis using R. I used the libraries readr, and dplyr which helped me to build the project. I analyze the data of CoolTShirts.com to gain a better understanding and insight on visits to their website. In order to do this I built a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process. 

In this case, the funnel describes the following process:
1. A user visits CoolTShirts.com
2. A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
3. A user clicks "checkout"
4. A user purchases a t-shirt
 
### Note:

This data comes from CoolTShirts.com
